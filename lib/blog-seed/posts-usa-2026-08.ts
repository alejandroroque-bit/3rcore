    author_name: AUTHOR,
    content: `<p class="lead"><strong>Short answer:</strong> in 2026 a single UGC video costs between <strong>$150 and $2,000+</strong> in the U.S. market. Entry-tier creators sit at $150–$350 per asset, mid-tier at $350–$800, and established creators with proven conversion history at $800–$2,000. Agency-produced batches typically land at <strong>$120–$300 per asset</strong> because scripting, casting and editing are amortized across the batch. The variable that moves price most isn't follower count — it's usage rights.</p>

<h2>Why the same brief gets quoted $200 and $1,500</h2>
<p>If you post one UGC brief in five places, you'll get quotes an order of magnitude apart. That spread is not a negotiating game. It reflects four things that are genuinely different between quotes, and almost nobody itemizes them.</p>
<p>The first is <strong>what "one video" means</strong>. For some creators it means one raw clip. For others it means a finished, captioned, platform-cut asset with two hook variations. Those are different products with the same name.</p>
<p>The second is <strong>usage rights</strong>, which we'll come back to because it's the single biggest driver. The third is <strong>revision terms</strong>. The fourth is whether <strong>the creator is scripting</strong> or executing a script you supply.</p>

<h2>UGC rates by creator tier, 2026</h2>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Tier</th><th>Per finished asset</th><th>What you typically get</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Entry / emerging</strong></td><td>$150 – $350</td><td>One cut, basic editing, organic usage only. Quality varies widely — you're buying volume, not consistency.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Mid-tier</strong></td><td>$350 – $800</td><td>Scripted delivery, captions, one or two hook variations, 3–6 month paid usage. The workhorse band for most brands.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Established</strong></td><td>$800 – $2,000</td><td>Track record of converting, faster turnaround, negotiable exclusivity. Worth it when you already know the angle works.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Agency batch</strong></td><td>$120 – $300</td><td>Per-asset cost across a batch of 8+, including angle research, scripting, casting, editing and per-platform variations.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The agency band looks lower than entry-tier creators, which surprises people. The reason is amortization: angle research and scripting happen once for the batch, casting is a fixed process, and filming several assets in one block spreads setup across all of them. The tradeoff is that batches have a minimum size — the economics only work from roughly eight assets up.</p>

<h2>Usage rights: the line item that doubles the invoice</h2>
<p>This is where most first-time UGC buyers get surprised. A quote for "a UGC video" usually covers <strong>organic usage</strong> — the creator posts it, you can repost it. The moment you want to put paid media budget behind that asset, you're buying a different thing: <strong>paid usage rights</strong>, sometimes called whitelisting or ad licensing.</p>
<p>Typical structures in 2026:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organic only</strong> — included in base rate.</li>
<li><strong>Paid usage, 3 months</strong> — adds roughly 25–50% to the base rate.</li>
<li><strong>Paid usage, 12 months</strong> — adds roughly 50–100%.</li>
<li><strong>Perpetual, all channels</strong> — adds 100–200%, and many creators won't sell it at any price.</li>
<li><strong>Category exclusivity</strong> — priced separately, usually a significant premium.</li>
</ul>
<p>The expensive mistake is buying organic-only, discovering the asset performs, and going back to license paid usage <em>after</em> you've proven it works. You've just eliminated your own negotiating position. Buy the rights you might need up front, when nobody knows yet whether the video is any good.</p>

<h2>What actually drives cost, in order</h2>
<h3>1. Usage rights and term</h3>
<p>Already covered, and it's genuinely first. A $300 video with 12-month paid rights is cheaper in practice than a $200 video you can only post organically.</p>
<h3>2. Number of deliverables per shoot</h3>
<p>Asking for three hook variations of the same script costs far less than three separate scripts, because the setup, the creator's time and the wardrobe are already paid for. If your budget is fixed, buy variations rather than more concepts — testing hooks is where the early gains are.</p>
<h3>3. Revision rounds</h3>
<p>Unlimited revisions sound like buyer protection but they price into the quote. Two rounds against a written brief is the practical standard. If you're going past two, the brief was the problem.</p>
<h3>4. Turnaround</h3>
<p>Standard is 10–15 business days from approved script. Rush delivery under a week typically carries a 25–50% premium, and rushing tends to cost more than it saves because it compresses the review stage.</p>
<h3>5. Creator specificity</h3>
<p>A creator with a specific credential — a nurse for a healthcare product, a contractor for tools — costs more and converts better than a generalist. This is one of the few places where paying up reliably pays back.</p>

<h2>Direct-to-creator vs agency: an honest comparison</h2>
<p>Hiring creators directly is cheaper per asset at low volume and more expensive per asset at high volume, because the coordination cost is real and it lands on you.</p>
<table>
<thead><tr><th></th><th>Direct to creator</th><th>Through an agency</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Cost per asset (1–3 videos)</td><td>Lower</td><td>Higher</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cost per asset (8+ videos)</td><td>Higher</td><td>Lower</td></tr>
<tr><td>Who writes the angles</td><td>You</td><td>Agency</td></tr>
<tr><td>Who chases revisions</td><td>You</td><td>Agency</td></tr>
<tr><td>Risk if a creator ghosts</td><td>Yours</td><td>Agency's</td></tr>
<tr><td>Contract and rights handling</td><td>You draft it</td><td>Standardized</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If you're testing whether UGC works for your product at all, going direct with two or three creators is a sensible, cheap experiment. If you've already decided UGC is a channel and you need a steady monthly flow, coordination becomes the dominant cost and batching wins.</p>

<h2>How many videos do you actually need?</h2>
<p>The honest floor is <strong>six to eight assets covering three or four distinct angles</strong>. Below that you can't learn anything: if you test two videos and both underperform, you can't distinguish a bad format from a bad angle.</p>
<p>For brands actively scaling paid social, the sustainable rhythm is <strong>8–15 new assets per month</strong>. Creative fatigue is real and measurable — the same asset shown to the same audience degrades in cost per result within weeks. A steady creative supply is what keeps a scaling account from hitting a ceiling.</p>

<h2>Nearshore production and what it changes</h2>
<p>One structural way to change the math is to produce outside the U.S. cost base. Our own team produces in Lima, Peru, on Eastern Time, which means U.S. business hours overlap fully — briefs sent in the morning get worked the same morning rather than overnight.</p>
<p>The saving isn't from cheaper work; it's from a different operating cost behind the same senior people. In practice, brands redirect that difference into volume: more variations, more tests, more iterations per month for the same spend. That matters more than the unit price, because on platforms that optimize by creative, volume of tested variations <em>is</em> the performance lever.</p>

<h2>Budgeting checklist before you commission anything</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Decide the usage rights you need</strong> before requesting quotes, not after.</li>
<li><strong>Write the angles first.</strong> Four hypotheses about why someone buys, not four aesthetic directions.</li>
<li><strong>Budget for a batch, not a video.</strong> One asset produces no learning.</li>
<li><strong>Confirm the deliverable format.</strong> Raw clip or finished, captioned, platform-cut asset?</li>
<li><strong>Cap revisions at two</strong> and put the brief in writing so both sides are measuring against the same thing.</li>
<li><strong>Name files by angle and hook</strong> so the campaign report tells you which idea won, not which file did.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3>Is more expensive UGC better?</h3>
<p>Above the entry tier, price correlates more with rights and reliability than with on-screen quality. A $700 asset isn't twice as persuasive as a $350 one. It's usually the same persuasion with better usage terms and a creator who delivers on schedule.</p>
<h3>Can I use the same video on Meta and TikTok?</h3>
<p>You can, but it underperforms. Each platform has a different grammar — TikTok rewards a spoken hook and fast cuts, Meta leans harder on captions and tolerates a slightly longer build. Ship per-platform cuts rather than one re-cropped master.</p>
<h3>Do I need to disclose that a UGC video is an ad?</h3>
<p>If a creator is posting it on their own account, yes — the FTC requires clear and conspicuous disclosure of material connections. If you're running it as an ad from your own brand account, the ad label itself handles it.</p>

<h2>Where to start</h2>
<p>If you're pricing UGC for the first time, start with the rights you need and the number of angles you want to test — those two decisions determine the budget more than any rate card.

    content: `<p class="lead"><strong>Summary:</strong> offshore usually means Asia or Eastern Europe with an 8–13 hour gap from U.S. business hours. Nearshore means Latin America, with a 0–3 hour gap. The rate difference between them is smaller than most people assume. The <strong>coordination difference is enormous</strong>, and it's what determines whether an outsourced team can be trusted with work that requires judgment rather than just execution.</p>

<h2>The comparison nobody makes correctly</h2>
<p>Outsourcing decisions get made on a spreadsheet comparing hourly rates. That spreadsheet is missing the largest cost, which is the time your own team spends unblocking the outsourced one.</p>
<p>Here's the mechanism. Every project generates questions that weren't anticipated in the brief. With a team in your time zone, a question asked at 10am is answered by 10:15am and work continues. With a team twelve hours out, the question is asked at 10am your time, read at the start of their day, answered while you sleep, and you read the answer the next morning — by which point you have a follow-up question. <strong>One ambiguity costs two days.</strong></p>
<p>Most projects contain a dozen of those ambiguities. That's the real difference, and it never shows up in the rate comparison.</p>

<h2>Where offshore genuinely wins</h2>
<p>This isn't a case against offshore. Offshore is the right answer for work that can be <strong>fully specified in advance</strong> and doesn't need mid-flight judgment: bulk image editing, data entry, standardized production against a rigid template, QA passes with clear pass/fail criteria.</p>
<p>For that category, the time gap can even be an advantage — you hand off at end of day and results are waiting in the morning. The overnight cycle works <em>for</em> you when the work needs no conversation.</p>

<h2>Where the time gap breaks things</h2>
<p>Marketing work is mostly the other category. Consider a paid media account: a campaign underperforms on a Tuesday morning, the manager needs to decide whether it's the creative, the audience or the landing page, and that decision requires context only your team has. Offshore, that's Wednesday. Nearshore, that's before lunch.</p>
<p>The same applies to creative production. A UGC batch where the first cut misses the tone needs a conversation, not a ticket. Campaign launches with a live client review need people awake at the same time. Crisis response — a bad review going viral, an ad account suspension — needs an answer in hours.</p>

<h2>The cultural piece, specifically for U.S. consumer marketing</h2>
<p>Marketing to U.S. consumers requires knowing what the reference points mean. Humor, holidays, regional differences, what reads as trustworthy versus salesy — these are learned by exposure, not briefed.</p>
<p>Latin America has structurally more exposure to U.S. culture: shared media, shared platforms, high familiarity with U.S. consumer norms. That shows up in small but expensive ways — copy that lands rather than parses, creative that feels native rather than translated.</p>
<p>The clearest case is <strong>U.S. Hispanic marketing</strong>. Roughly 40 million people in the U.S. speak Spanish, and the majority of brands reach them by machine-translating English ads. Spanish written by native speakers who understand the U.S. context is a different product entirely, and it's one nearshore teams are uniquely positioned to produce.</p>

<h2>What actually drives quality (it isn't location)</h2>
<p>Location determines coordination cost, not quality. Quality comes from three things you should verify regardless of geography:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Portfolio in your category.</strong> Not "we do marketing" — work for businesses that look like yours, with outcomes attached.</li>
<li><strong>A named point of contact who owns the account.</strong> Work routed through a rotating pool loses context every handoff, and context is most of the value.</li>
<li><strong>Ownership terms in writing.</strong> Assets, ad accounts, tracking configuration and code should live in your properties from day one. Anything else is a retention strategy disguised as a workflow.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Practical structure that works</h2>
<p>The arrangement we see succeed most often isn't full replacement. It's an internal marketing lead who owns strategy and relationships, with an outsourced team supplying execution capacity underneath — creative volume, campaign management, technical work.</p>
<p>That structure works because the judgment calls that need deep company context stay inside, and the work that scales with hours moves to where hours cost less. It only functions if the outsourced team can be reached during the internal lead's working day, which brings the argument back to time zones.</p>

<h2>Questions to ask before signing anything</h2>
<ul>
<li>What hours does the team actually work, in <em>my</em> time zone?</li>
<li>Who is my named contact, and what happens when they're out?</li>
<li>Are deliverables, timelines and revision rounds fixed in the scope, or is this hourly and open-ended?</li>
<li>Whose ad accounts, analytics properties and repositories does the work live in?</li>
<li>What's the process when something needs a decision in the next two hours?</li>
<li>Can I see work in my category, with the outcome, not just the asset?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where we sit</h2>
<p>3R Core operates from Lima, Peru — Eastern Time, or one hour behind depending on daylight saving. In practice the U.S. business day and ours are the same day. We work under fixed scopes quoted in U.S. dollars, with deliverables and revision rounds specified, and everything built in your accounts.</p>
<p>If you're weighing a U.S. retainer against offshore against building internally, it's worth pricing the third option. <a href="/en/nearshore-marketing-agency">See how the nearshore model works</a>, or send us your current scope and spend and we'll come back with what the same budget buys in output.</p>`,

    author_name: AUTHOR,
    content: `<p class="lead"><strong>The short version:</strong> paying a creator to make a video does not, by default, give you the right to advertise with it. Copyright in the footage sits with whoever created it, and what you buy is a <strong>license</strong> — bounded by channel, term and geography. The disputes that get expensive almost never concern quality. They concern rights nobody specified before filming.</p>

<h2>Why this matters more than it sounds</h2>
<p>The problem surfaces at the worst possible moment. You commission a batch, one asset outperforms everything else, you decide to put serious budget behind it — and only then discover the agreement covered organic posting only. Now you're renegotiating from a position where the creator knows exactly how valuable that asset is to you.</p>
<p>The fix costs nothing: decide the rights you need <em>before</em> anyone films, when nobody knows yet which asset will win.</p>

<h2>The four things a UGC license defines</h2>
<h3>1. Channel — where you can run it</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organic:</strong> posting on your own accounts as regular content.</li>
<li><strong>Paid social:</strong> running it as an ad on Meta, TikTok, YouTube, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Whitelisting / creator licensing:</strong> running paid ads <em>from the creator's handle</em>, which typically outperforms brand-handle delivery because the social proof stays attached.</li>
<li><strong>Owned properties:</strong> website, email, product pages.</li>
<li><strong>Offline / broadcast:</strong> retail screens, TV, out-of-home — almost always priced separately and often excluded.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Term — how long</h3>
<p>Common terms are 3, 6 and 12 months, with perpetual available at a premium and sometimes not at all. A term that expires while a campaign is still running is a live compliance problem, so match the term to your realistic campaign horizon rather than the minimum.</p>
<h3>3. Territory — where geographically</h3>
<p>Usually worldwide or U.S.-only. Worldwide costs slightly more and prevents an awkward conversation if you later expand.</p>
<h3>4. Exclusivity — who else the creator can work with</h3>
<p>Category exclusivity prevents the creator from promoting a competitor for a defined period. It's priced separately and is genuinely expensive, because you're asking them to turn down income. Most brands don't need it; brands in crowded categories where the same creators serve everyone sometimes do.</p>

<h2>What each level typically costs</h2>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Right</th><th>Typical uplift on base rate</th><th>When you need it</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Organic only</td><td>Included</td><td>Testing content that will never be an ad</td></tr>
<tr><td>Paid social, 3 months</td><td>+25–50%</td><td>Short campaign or seasonal push</td></tr>
<tr><td>Paid social, 12 months</td><td>+50–100%</td><td>Default for anything you intend to scale</td></tr>
<tr><td>Whitelisting from creator handle</td><td>+50–100%</td><td>When creator credibility is part of the performance</td></tr>
<tr><td>Perpetual, all channels</td><td>+100–200%</td><td>Evergreen assets you'll reuse for years</td></tr>
<tr><td>Category exclusivity</td><td>Negotiated, often substantial</td><td>Crowded categories with a shared creator pool</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Reading this table, the practical conclusion for most advertisers is: <strong>buy 12-month paid social rights by default.</strong> The uplift is modest against the cost of discovering you need them later.</p>

<h2>Clauses worth having in writing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grant of license</strong> — channels, term, territory, stated explicitly rather than implied.</li>
<li><strong>Raw footage delivery</strong> — whether you receive source files or only the finished cut. Raw files let you re-edit for new hooks without reshooting, which is worth a lot.</li>
<li><strong>Editing rights</strong> — permission to re-cut, add captions, change music, produce variations.</li>
<li><strong>Renewal terms</strong> — the price of extending, agreed now rather than after the asset proves itself.</li>
<li><strong>Warranties</strong> — the creator confirms the content is theirs, music is cleared, and no third party appears without consent.</li>
<li><strong>Disclosure obligations</strong> — who is responsible for FTC-compliant disclosure on organic posts.</li>
<li><strong>Takedown process</strong> — what happens if the creator later wants an asset pulled, and what notice applies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The three mistakes that cost real money</h2>
<h3>Buying rights after the asset performs</h3>
<p>Already covered, and it's the most common by a wide margin. Negotiate before anyone knows the answer.</p>
<h3>Assuming music is cleared</h3>
<p>A creator using a trending sound on their own post is operating under the platform's license for organic content. That license generally does <strong>not</strong> extend to paid advertising. Running the same audio as an ad can get the ad rejected, or worse. Commercial-cleared audio or no audio bed is the safe default for paid.</p>
<h3>Ignoring people in the background</h3>
<p>If someone identifiable appears in the footage — a friend, a customer, a child — you need their consent for commercial use too. This is easy to handle before filming and awkward to handle after.</p>

<h2>Disclosure: what the FTC actually requires</h2>
<p>When a creator posts sponsored content on their own account, the FTC requires that the material connection be disclosed <strong>clearly and conspicuously</strong>. In practice that means a visible statement — "#ad", "paid partnership", or plain language — placed where viewers will actually see it, not buried below a fold or at the end of a caption.</p>
<p>Two things worth knowing. First, platform partnership labels help but the FTC treats the advertiser as responsible for compliance, so it's your process, not just the creator's. Second, disclosure doesn't measurably hurt performance — audiences already assume a commercial arrangement exists.</p>
<p>Ads you run from your own brand account are already identified as advertising, so no additional creator disclosure is required there.</p>

<h2>A practical default</h2>
<p>For most advertisers running paid social, this covers it:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>12-month paid social rights, worldwide, with editing rights and raw footage delivery, no category exclusivity, renewal price agreed up front, and commercially cleared audio.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>That combination costs meaningfully less than perpetual-everything and eliminates essentially every scenario where you're stuck.</p>

<h2>How we handle it</h2>
<p>Every creator agreement we run includes paid-media usage for the agreed term and platforms, editing rights, raw footage delivery and warranties on music and third-party appearances, settled before filming. It's administrative work that looks unnecessary right up until the moment it isn't.</p>

    author_name: AUTHOR,
    content: `<p class="lead"><strong>The core problem:</strong> more than 40 million people in the United States speak Spanish, and a large share of them search, compare and buy in it. Most brands trying to reach that audience translate their English campaign. Translation preserves meaning and discards tone — and tone is what makes an ad feel like it's addressed to you. The result is copy that's technically correct and reliably ignored.</p>

<h2>What translation actually loses</h2>
<p>A translated ad reads as competent and foreign at the same time. The vocabulary is right, the grammar is right, and something is off. Audiences who live bilingually are highly practiced at spotting the difference between a brand speaking to them and a brand that ran its English through a translator.</p>
<p>Three specific things get lost:</p>
<h3>Register</h3>
<p>English marketing copy leans on a register that doesn't map cleanly. Direct imperatives that read as energetic in English often read as brusque in Spanish. Enthusiasm that feels normal in an English headline can feel like shouting. Translated copy inherits the English register and lands wrong.</p>
<h3>The specific variety of Spanish</h3>
<p>U.S. Spanish isn't one thing. Miami's Spanish carries Cuban and Venezuelan influence; Los Angeles skews Mexican; New York has strong Dominican and Puerto Rican presence; Houston and Chicago differ again. Vocabulary for everyday things varies between them. A translator producing "neutral Spanish" produces something that belongs to nobody.</p>
<h3>Code-switching as a norm</h3>
<p>A large portion of U.S. Hispanic consumers move between English and Spanish within the same sentence. Some English terms are simply what people say — "el bill", "hacer un appointment". Copy that painstakingly translates every term into formal Spanish sounds less natural than copy that leaves the terms people actually use.</p>

<h2>Where the money actually is</h2>
<p>The commercial argument is stronger than the cultural one, because the competitive dynamics favor you.</p>
<p>Most advertisers in a given local market are competing in English. That means Spanish-language search terms in the same category frequently carry <strong>lower cost per click for comparable purchase intent</strong>, simply because fewer advertisers are bidding. The same asymmetry shows up in organic search: Spanish queries in a service area often have far weaker competing content than their English equivalents, so ranking is achievable in months rather than years.</p>
<p>This advantage is temporary. It exists because the market is underserved, and it narrows as more advertisers notice.</p>

<h2>How to structure it properly</h2>
<h3>Separate campaigns, not translated ad copy inside the same campaign</h3>
<p>Run Spanish as its own campaign structure. That lets you write native ad copy, budget independently, and read results without them blending into English performance. Target by language and by geography — the concentration of Spanish speakers varies enormously by metro, and by neighborhood within a metro.</p>
<h3>A real Spanish section on the site, marked correctly</h3>
<p>Sending Spanish-language traffic to an English landing page wastes the click. But the fix isn't necessarily rebuilding the site — a properly built Spanish section with correct <code>hreflang</code> annotation usually suffices. What matters technically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distinct URLs for the Spanish version, not a JavaScript language toggle that serves the same URL.</li>
<li><code>hreflang</code> declared reciprocally between the English and Spanish versions, including <code>es-US</code> specifically rather than generic <code>es</code>.</li>
<li>Forms, error messages and confirmation pages in Spanish too. A Spanish landing page with an English checkout leaks conversions precisely at the moment of commitment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creative shot in Spanish, not dubbed</h3>
<p>Subtitled or dubbed English video reads as an afterthought. Video with a Spanish-speaking presenter, filmed as Spanish, performs differently — and the production cost gap has narrowed to the point where it rarely justifies dubbing.</p>
<h3>WhatsApp as a real channel</h3>
<p>This is consistently underestimated by U.S. marketers. Hispanic consumers frequently prefer messaging a business over filling out a form, and offering WhatsApp visibly tends to raise contact volume immediately. The critical part is <strong>tracking it</strong> — an unmeasured channel that produces customers makes the entire campaign look like it failed.</p>

<h2>What to measure</h2>
<p>Report Spanish separately from English. If they're blended you learn nothing about either. Track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost per qualified lead, Spanish vs English</li>
<li>Conversion rate by landing page language</li>
<li>Contact channel split — form, call, WhatsApp</li>
<li>Cost per click for equivalent intent in each language</li>
</ul>
<p>The pattern we see most often: Spanish delivers lower cost per lead and a lower on-site conversion rate, because the ads are cheap but the site experience degrades after the click. That diagnosis is only visible if the two are measured separately.</p>

<h2>Common mistakes</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Machine translation with no native review.</strong> The failure mode isn't errors — it's flatness, which is harder to notice and just as costly.</li>
<li><strong>One "neutral Spanish" for the whole country.</strong> Decide which community you're primarily addressing.</li>
<li><strong>Spanish ads pointing to English pages.</strong> The most common and most expensive.</li>
<li><strong>No <code>hreflang</code>.</strong> Google then guesses which version to show, and guesses wrong often enough to matter.</li>
<li><strong>Translating the ad but not the follow-up.</strong> Reply emails, SMS and the sales call also need to be in Spanish.</li>
<li><strong>Treating it as a translation project rather than a market.</strong> Different audience, different offer emphasis, different objections.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Getting started without rebuilding everything</h2>
<p>A reasonable first phase is narrow: pick your highest-intent service, write native Spanish ads for it, build one properly marked Spanish landing page, add WhatsApp with tracking, and run it as a separate campaign for ninety days. That's enough to produce a real cost-per-lead comparison against English, and it doesn't require touching the rest of the site.</p>
<p>If the numbers work — and in underserved categories they usually do — you expand from evidence rather than from conviction.</p>
