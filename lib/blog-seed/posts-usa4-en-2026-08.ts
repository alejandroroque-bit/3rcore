<p><strong>Short answer: a Shopify store costs $25 to $399 per month for the platform, plus a one-time build that starts around $1,750 for a store with a real catalog, payment gateway and admin panel. Apps and payment processing sit on top.</strong> The monthly plan is the number everyone quotes and the smallest part of the bill.</p>

<p>This breaks down every line, with the figures checked against Shopify's own pricing page on 28 August 2026.</p>

<h2>How much is the Shopify plan itself?</h2>

<p><strong>Shopify Basic is $25 per month billed monthly, or $19 per month billed annually.</strong> The full ladder, as published by Shopify:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Plan</th><th>Billed monthly</th><th>Billed annually</th><th>Third-party gateway fee</th></tr>
<tr><td>Basic</td><td>$25/mo</td><td>$19/mo</td><td>2%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Grow</td><td>$65/mo</td><td>$49/mo</td><td>1%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Advanced</td><td>$399/mo</td><td>$299/mo</td><td>0.6%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Plus</td><td>from $2,300/mo</td><td>—</td><td>0.2%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Most stores doing under roughly 100 orders a month have no reason to leave Basic. The jump to Grow and Advanced buys lower transaction fees and reporting, so it pays for itself only once volume makes the percentage bigger than the plan difference.</p>

<h2>What is the third-party gateway fee, and why does it matter?</h2>

<p><strong>If you process payments through anything other than Shopify Payments, Shopify charges an extra percentage of every sale on top of what your processor charges: 2% on Basic, 1% on Grow, 0.6% on Advanced and 0.2% on Plus.</strong> This is the line item that quietly changes which plan is cheapest for you, and most cost comparisons skip it.</p>

<p>Do the arithmetic before you pick a plan. A store on Basic doing $30,000 a month through an external gateway pays $600 a month in surcharge alone — more than ten times the plan. Moving to Grow at $65 cuts that to $300. The plan comparison that matters is not $25 against $65; it is $25 + 2% against $65 + 1%.</p>

<p>Using Shopify Payments removes the surcharge entirely. Whether that is the right call depends on your processing rates and whether Shopify Payments supports your business category, which is worth confirming before you commit.</p>

<h2>How much does it cost to have someone build the store?</h2>

<p><strong>At 3R Core, a Shopify or WooCommerce store starts at $1,750 USD</strong>, and that covers catalog setup, payment gateway, inventory management and the admin panel. The range above that depends on three things and nothing else: how many products, how much custom design, and how many systems it has to talk to.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Catalog size.</strong> Forty products with clean data is a different job from four thousand with variants, and it is the single biggest driver of hours.</li>
<li><strong>Design.</strong> A well-configured premium theme is fast. A design built from scratch in Figma and then developed is not, and it should not be priced as if it were.</li>
<li><strong>Integrations.</strong> ERP, accounting, a warehouse, a subscription engine. Each one is real engineering, and each one is where quotes diverge.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cheaper offers exist and some are legitimate — a template installed with a small catalog can genuinely be a few hundred dollars. What you should ask is what happens after launch: who fixes the checkout when it breaks, and whether analytics and conversion tracking were installed before launch or bolted on afterward. We install them before, because a store that has been live for two months without tracking has two months of unmeasured decisions behind it.</p>

<h2>What do apps add to the monthly bill?</h2>

<p><strong>Budget $0 to $150 a month for apps on a normal small store.</strong> Shopify's app ecosystem is the reason the platform is pleasant and the reason bills drift.</p>

<p>The pattern we see repeatedly: a store launches with four apps, someone adds a review widget, then an upsell tool, then a loyalty program, and eighteen months later there are eleven subscriptions and nobody can say which ones are earning their keep. Review the list quarterly and cancel what has not been opened. It is the cheapest cost saving in ecommerce.</p>

<h2>What about payment processing?</h2>

<p><strong>Payment processing is a percentage of every sale and it is not optional on any platform.</strong> Rates depend on your processor, your country and your business category, so any article quoting a single universal number is guessing. Get the rate from your processor in writing before you model your margins.</p>

<p>What matters for the comparison here is that processing is charged whichever platform you choose. It is not a Shopify cost; it is a cost of accepting cards.</p>

<h2>Shopify versus WooCommerce: which is actually cheaper?</h2>

<p><strong>WooCommerce has no platform fee — the core plugin is free — but it moves the cost to hosting and extensions, which WooCommerce publishes as $25–$350 per month for hosting and $29–$299 per year per paid extension.</strong> So "free" is a description of the software, not of the project.</p>

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Shopify</th><th>WooCommerce</th></tr>
<tr><td>Platform fee</td><td>$25–$399/mo</td><td>$0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hosting</td><td>Included</td><td>$25–$350/mo</td></tr>
<tr><td>Extensions / apps</td><td>Per app, monthly</td><td>$29–$299/yr each</td></tr>
<tr><td>Third-party gateway surcharge</td><td>0.2%–2%</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Who keeps it patched</td><td>Shopify</td><td>You or your agency</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The honest summary: Shopify costs more in visible monthly fees and less in attention. WooCommerce costs less in fees and more in maintenance, because updates, security and compatibility are now your problem. Pick based on whether you have someone to own that, not on the headline price. We build on both and say the same thing to every client.</p>

<h2>What does the first year actually cost?</h2>

<p><strong>For a small U.S. store built properly: roughly $1,750–$3,000 one-time for the build, plus $300–$800 for the year on the Shopify plan, plus apps and processing.</strong> That is the realistic band for a business launching with a manageable catalog and no exotic integrations.</p>

<p>The number that ruins budgets is never the plan. It is the rebuild eighteen months later because the first store was built without tracking, without a migration path and without anyone who understood the checkout. That rebuild costs more than doing it once.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3>How much does a Shopify store cost per month?</h3>
<p>The plan is $25/mo on Basic, $65 on Grow and $399 on Advanced, discounted to $19, $49 and $299 respectively when billed annually. Add apps, which commonly run $0–$150 a month, and payment processing charged as a percentage of sales.</p>

<h3>Is Shopify cheaper than hiring a developer?</h3>
<p>They are not alternatives. Shopify is the platform; a developer builds the store on it. You will pay the plan either way. What a developer changes is whether the store is configured correctly at launch — catalog, gateway, tax and tracking — or configured by trial and error afterward.</p>

<h3>Can I build a Shopify store myself?</h3>
<p>Yes, and for a first store with a handful of products it is a reasonable way to learn what you actually need. The parts that most often go wrong unattended are state-level sales tax, shipping rules and conversion tracking, because all three fail silently — the store keeps taking orders and the numbers are simply wrong.</p>

<h3>How much does 3R Core charge for a Shopify store?</h3>
<p>Stores start at $1,750 USD, including catalog, payment gateway, inventory management and admin panel. Websites start at $850 and corporate sites at $1,200 (range $1,200–$2,400 depending on scope). Prices are net, in U.S. dollars, with no mandatory contract.</p>

    content: `
<p><strong>A small business website in the United States generally costs between $850 and $10,000 to build, with most owner-operated businesses landing between $1,200 and $2,400.</strong> The spread is wide because "website" describes a one-page landing and a fifty-page site with a booking system equally well.</p>

<p>Here is what each band actually buys, using published prices rather than ranges invented to sound reasonable.</p>

<h2>What does each price band include?</h2>

<p><strong>At 3R Core the bands are: landing page from $850, corporate site from $1,200 with a range of $1,200–$2,400 by scope, and ecommerce from $1,750.</strong> Every proposal includes Figma design, responsive development, basic technical SEO, a contact form and Google Analytics, and the first year includes domain, SSL and hosting.</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Type</th><th>Price</th><th>What it is for</th></tr>
<tr><td>Professional landing page</td><td>from $850</td><td>One offer, one action. Ads traffic, a single service, a launch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Corporate website</td><td>$1,200–$2,400</td><td>5–8 sections. The default for an established small business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ecommerce</td><td>from $1,750</td><td>Catalog, payment gateway, inventory, admin panel.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Above $5,000 you are usually buying something specific rather than something bigger: a booking or quoting engine, a members area, a multi-location structure, an integration with software you already run. If a quote is above that band and cannot name which of those it is, ask.</p>

<h2>What actually makes a website cost more?</h2>

<p><strong>Four things move the number, and page count is not really one of them.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Custom design versus a configured theme.</strong> Designing in Figma and then developing that design is roughly twice the work of configuring a good theme well. Both are legitimate. Only one should be priced as the other.</li>
<li><strong>Functionality.</strong> A contact form is trivial. Booking with availability, quoting with logic, a customer portal, a payment flow — each is software, and software is where hours live.</li>
<li><strong>Content.</strong> Who writes the copy and sources the photography? "Client provides content" is the most common reason projects stall for months, and the most common thing missing from a cheap quote.</li>
<li><strong>Languages.</strong> A bilingual site is not a translated site. It needs separate URLs per language and hreflang declared in both directions, and the copy needs to be written in each language rather than run through translation. For U.S. businesses serving Spanish-speaking customers this is usually the highest-return decision on the whole project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are the recurring costs after launch?</h2>

<p><strong>Budget for domain, hosting, SSL and maintenance every year — commonly $100 to $600 annually for a small business site, more if the site runs a store.</strong> These rarely appear in the initial quote and they are not optional.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Domain:</strong> typically $10–$20 a year for a .com.</li>
<li><strong>Hosting:</strong> from a few dollars a month on shared hosting to hundreds on managed hosting. WooCommerce publishes $25–$350 a month as the realistic range for a store.</li>
<li><strong>SSL:</strong> free through Let's Encrypt on most modern hosts. If someone is charging you separately for it, ask why.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> updates, backups and security. On WordPress this is real work, not a formality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Is a cheap website a false economy?</h2>

<p><strong>Not always — a template site for a business that needs a presence and nothing more is a perfectly rational purchase.</strong> The false economy is specific and identifiable: a site built with no analytics, no conversion tracking and no way to edit it without going back to whoever built it.</p>

<p>We audit sites in that state regularly. The pattern is consistent: the business has been live for a year, has no idea which pages produce enquiries, cannot change a phone number without paying for it, and is about to pay again for a rebuild. The first build was cheap. The two years were not.</p>

<p>The concrete test before you sign: can you edit text yourself, is analytics installed and configured, and do you own the domain and the hosting account in your own name? Three yeses and the price is probably fine, whatever it is.</p>

<h2>Should the site be bilingual?</h2>

<p><strong>If a meaningful share of your customers speak Spanish, a properly built bilingual site is usually the highest-return addition to the project — and it costs less than doing it later.</strong> Retrofitting a second language onto a site that was not planned for it means restructuring URLs, which is the expensive version.</p>

<p>Done properly means each language has its own URL, hreflang is declared reciprocally so Google serves the right version to the right searcher, and the Spanish is written rather than translated. That last part matters more than it sounds: a translated page inherits the English page's headings, and those headings were written for a query nobody typed in Spanish.</p>

<h2>How long does it take?</h2>

<p><strong>A landing page runs one to two weeks; a corporate site three to six; ecommerce four to eight, depending on catalog size.</strong> The variable is almost never development. It is content and feedback: the fastest projects we run are the ones where the client has copy and photography ready and one named decision-maker.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3>How much does a website cost per month for a small business?</h3>
<p>Ongoing costs are typically $10–$50 a month for domain and hosting on a standard site, plus any maintenance retainer. Stores cost more because hosting requirements are higher — WooCommerce publishes $25–$350 a month for hosting.</p>

<h3>Is it cheaper to build the website myself?</h3>
<p>In cash, yes. Site builders are inexpensive and genuinely capable now. What you are spending instead is your time, and the parts that usually go wrong unsupervised are technical SEO, page speed and conversion tracking — none of which announce themselves as broken.</p>

<h3>Why do website quotes vary so much for the same brief?</h3>
<p>Usually because the briefs are not the same even when they read that way. Custom design versus configured theme, who writes the copy, whether tracking is included, whether hosting and domain are in the first year. Ask for those four line items on every quote and most of the spread explains itself.</p>

<h3>What does 3R Core charge for a website?</h3>
<p>Landing pages from $850, corporate sites from $1,200 (range $1,200–$2,400 by scope) and ecommerce from $1,750. Every proposal includes Figma design, responsive development, basic technical SEO, contact form and Google Analytics; the first year includes domain, SSL and hosting. Net prices in U.S. dollars.</p>

<p><strong>SEO agency retainers in the United States run from roughly $500 to $10,000 per month, and proposals at both ends describe the same activities.</strong> That is the actual problem with buying SEO: the deliverable list is nearly identical whatever you pay, so the price tells you almost nothing on its own.</p>

<p>What follows is what separates the bands, and how to read a proposal before signing one.</p>

<h2>What do the price bands actually buy?</h2>

<p><strong>The variable is hours and seniority, not activities.</strong> Every SEO proposal contains an audit, on-page optimization, content and reporting. The difference is how many hours go in each month and who does them.</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Band</th><th>Typically buys</th><th>Fits</th></tr>
<tr><td>$500–$1,000/mo</td><td>Technical foundation, on-page, a modest content cadence, monthly reporting</td><td>Local and small businesses, low-competition query sets</td></tr>
<tr><td>$1,500–$4,000/mo</td><td>The above plus sustained content production and link acquisition</td><td>Competitive local markets, regional businesses</td></tr>
<tr><td>$5,000+/mo</td><td>Dedicated team, digital PR, large-scale content, technical engineering</td><td>National competition, ecommerce at scale</td></tr>
</table>

<p><strong>3R Core charges $500 USD per month for SEO</strong>, covering the initial audit, planning, on-page optimization, scaling and a monthly report, with no mandatory contract. That price is possible because the team is in Lima, Peru and carries Lima's cost base rather than a U.S. metro's — the same senior hours, a different overhead. We say that plainly rather than implying an efficiency that does not exist.</p>

<h2>Why is cheap SEO usually a bad deal?</h2>

<p><strong>Because below a certain price nobody can afford to do the work, so what gets delivered is the report rather than the results.</strong> The tell is a proposal heavy on activity counts — "20 keywords optimized", "5 blogs per month", "100 directory submissions" — and silent on outcomes.</p>

<p>Three specific things go wrong at the bottom of the market:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Content written to a word count.</strong> Pages that exist to be published rather than to answer anything. Google discovers them and declines to index them, which is a real status you can see in Search Console, and the work is simply gone.</li>
<li><strong>Links bought in bulk.</strong> Cheap link packages are cheap because the sites selling them sell to everyone. At best they do nothing.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting on the wrong number.</strong> Rankings for terms nobody searches, traffic that never converts. If the report does not tie to enquiries or revenue, it is not measuring the thing you bought.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What should be in the first 90 days?</h2>

<p><strong>Technical foundation first, content second, links last — in that order, because the other two do not compound on a broken base.</strong> A concrete first quarter looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Month 1:</strong> Technical audit and repair. Crawlability, indexation, canonicals, page speed, mobile. Baseline measurement so month 3 has something to compare against.</li>
<li><strong>Month 2:</strong> Keyword map with one page assigned per axis, so your own pages stop competing with each other. On-page work on the pages that already rank between positions 4 and 20, because those move fastest.</li>
<li><strong>Month 3:</strong> New content against mapped intent, internal linking so it connects to pages that already have authority, and the first report worth reading.</li>
</ul>

<p>The internal linking step is the one most often skipped and it is not cosmetic. A new page with no internal links pointing at it is a page Google discovers and frequently declines to index. Publishing without linking is publishing into a void.</p>

<h2>The three questions that expose a bad proposal</h2>

<p><strong>Ask these before signing. The answers separate agencies faster than any price comparison.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>"What will you report, and what does success look like in month 6?"</strong> A good answer names metrics tied to your business — qualified enquiries, revenue from organic, positions on commercial terms. A bad answer promises rankings on terms you have never heard of.</li>
<li><strong>"Who does the work, and where?"</strong> Not a trick question and not a gotcha. It is fine for work to be produced anywhere. It is not fine for you not to know, because that is how a $3,000 retainer becomes a junior's four hours a month.</li>
<li><strong>"What happens if I leave?"</strong> Content and accounts should be yours. If the pages live on the agency's domain or the analytics property is in their name, you are renting your own marketing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Should SEO be a retainer or a project?</h2>

<p><strong>A project fits a fixed job — a technical audit, a migration, a one-time cleanup. A retainer fits SEO itself, because search results are contested continuously and a one-time push decays.</strong></p>

<p>What a retainer should not be is a contract that locks you in while the work ramps down. Ours is monthly with no mandatory term, which puts the burden where it belongs: on us continuing to be worth it.</p>

<h2>How long before SEO pays for itself?</h2>

<p><strong>For low-competition local and long-tail terms, movement typically appears within a few months of consistent work. For competitive commercial terms it takes considerably longer.</strong> Anyone quoting a guaranteed date is quoting a number they do not control, and that is the single clearest signal in the whole buying process.</p>

<p>What can be committed to is the reporting: which queries moved, which did not, and what changes next month as a result.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3>How much does an SEO agency cost per month?</h3>
<p>Retainers commonly run $500–$10,000 a month depending on competition and scope. 3R Core charges $500 USD per month, including audit, planning, on-page optimization, scaling and a monthly report, with no mandatory contract.</p>

<h3>Is SEO worth it for a small business?</h3>
<p>It depends on whether people search for what you sell. If they do, organic search is durable in a way paid traffic is not — the pages keep working after the invoice. If your customers find you through referral or a marketplace instead, SEO is a poor first investment and a good agency will say so.</p>

<h3>What is the cheapest legitimate SEO?</h3>
<p>Below roughly $500 a month it is difficult to fund the hours real SEO takes. That does not make everything under it a scam, but it does mean you should ask exactly how many hours you are buying and who performs them.</p>

<h3>Does SEO in Spanish cost more?</h3>
<p>No. At 3R Core it is the same $500 per month, because the team's working language is Spanish. It often produces results faster, since far fewer competitors have built Spanish pages in most U.S. service categories.</p>

<p><strong>For most small businesses in the United States the practical choice is Shopify or WooCommerce, and the deciding question is not features — it is whether you have someone to maintain the store.</strong> Shopify maintains itself and charges for it. WooCommerce is free and expects you to do it.</p>

<p>We build on both and hold no affiliate arrangements with any platform, which is worth stating because most comparison articles ranking for this term do.</p>

<h2>Shopify: what it costs and who it fits</h2>

<p><strong>Shopify costs $25 to $399 a month ($19 to $299 billed annually) and fits businesses that want to sell rather than administer software.</strong> Hosting, security, updates and PCI compliance are Shopify's problem, and that is most of what you are buying.</p>

<p>The cost most people miss: <strong>if you use a payment provider other than Shopify Payments, Shopify adds 2% on Basic, 1% on Grow, 0.6% on Advanced and 0.2% on Plus to every transaction.</strong> On a store doing $30,000 a month on Basic through an external gateway, that surcharge is $600 — many times the plan itself. It changes which plan is cheapest, and sometimes whether Shopify is cheapest.</p>

<p><strong>Choose Shopify if:</strong> you sell physical products, you have no developer, uptime matters more than control, or you want to launch in weeks rather than months.</p>

<h2>WooCommerce: what it costs and who it fits</h2>

<p><strong>WooCommerce core is free and open source. The real cost is hosting at $25–$350 a month and paid extensions at $29–$299 per year each, per WooCommerce's own pricing page.</strong> There is no platform fee and no revenue share.</p>

<p>What you gain is control: your data, your server, any integration you can write, and no transaction surcharge. What you take on is maintenance. WordPress and its plugins need updating, and an unmaintained store is a security problem rather than an inconvenience. If nobody owns that, it will not happen.</p>

<p><strong>Choose WooCommerce if:</strong> you already run WordPress, you need custom logic Shopify will not allow, you have technical support available, or transaction volume makes the surcharge painful.</p>

<h2>What about Squarespace, Wix and BigCommerce?</h2>

<p><strong>They are viable and they fit narrower cases.</strong> Squarespace and Wix are excellent when the store is secondary to a beautiful site and the catalog is small; they become constraining as catalog and operations grow. BigCommerce is closest to Shopify and competes on not charging a third-party gateway surcharge, which matters most at higher volume.</p>

<p>None of them is a mistake for the right business. The mistake is choosing on the marketing site rather than on a list of what your store has to do.</p>

<h2>How should a small business actually decide?</h2>

<p><strong>Answer four questions and the platform usually picks itself.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Who maintains it?</strong> Nobody in-house and no agency retainer means Shopify. This one question decides most cases on its own.</li>
<li><strong>What must it integrate with?</strong> If your accounting, ERP or warehouse system has a WooCommerce plugin and no Shopify app, that decides it.</li>
<li><strong>What volume, and through which gateway?</strong> High volume through an external gateway makes Shopify's surcharge a real number. Model it before choosing.</li>
<li><strong>Do you need something the platform forbids?</strong> Complex B2B pricing, unusual subscription logic, regulated categories. If yes, you need the open platform.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What matters more than the platform</h2>

<p><strong>Whether measurement was installed before launch.</strong> Every platform on this list can run a profitable store. What separates stores that grow is knowing which products, channels and pages produce revenue — and that comes from analytics and conversion tracking configured at launch, not added once something feels wrong.</p>

<p>The second is sales tax. U.S. economic nexus rules mean a store can owe tax in states it has never physically been in, and this fails silently: the store keeps taking orders and the liability accumulates. It is configuration, not opinion, and it belongs in the build.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3>What is the cheapest ecommerce platform for a small business?</h3>
<p>WooCommerce has the lowest software cost, since the core plugin is free — but hosting runs $25–$350 a month and extensions $29–$299 a year each, so the total is not automatically lower. Shopify Basic at $19 a month billed annually is often cheaper in practice for a small catalog once hosting and maintenance are counted.</p>

<h3>Is Shopify better than WooCommerce?</h3>
<p>Neither is better in general. Shopify is better when you do not want to maintain software. WooCommerce is better when you need control or have volume that makes the third-party gateway surcharge expensive. We build on both.</p>

<h3>Can I move platforms later?</h3>
<p>Yes, and people do. Migration is real work — products, customers, orders, URLs and redirects — so it is worth choosing deliberately now. The part most often botched is redirects: without them, a migration throws away every ranking the old store earned.</p>

<h3>Which platform is best for a bilingual store?</h3>
<p>Both handle it, and both need it done properly: separate URLs per language and hreflang declared in both directions. The platform matters less than whether the Spanish is written rather than machine-translated, which is what determines whether it ranks and whether it converts.</p>
